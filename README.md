# PyBer_Analysis
Overview of the PyBer Analysis:

The purpose of this analysis was to show the ride sharing data based on the city type, rural, urban, and suburban, by creating a summary dataframe. Once the summary dataframe is created, we used the data to create a multiple line graph that displays the total weekly fares for each city type. In order to pull out the data we need, I used the Groupby(), count(), and sum () functions to get the total numbers of rides, drivers, and fares based on the city type. Next, I calculated the average fare per ride and driver. After that I had to format into a new datafram and re-format the columns. For the second deliverable, I used the pivot() and resample functions to create the multiple line graph
