# PyBer_Analysis
Overview of the PyBer Analysis:

The purpose of this analysis was to show the ride sharing data based on the city type, rural, urban, and suburban, by creating a summary dataframe. Once the summary dataframe is created, we used the data to create a multiple line graph that displays the total weekly fares for each city type. In order to pull out the data we need, I used the Groupby(), count(), and sum () functions to get the total numbers of rides, drivers, and fares based on the city type. Next, I calculated the average fare per ride and driver. After that I had to format into a new datafram and re-format the columns. For the second deliverable, I used the pivot() and resample functions to create the multiple line graph that compares the total fares for each city type from January 2019 to May 2019.


Results for each city type:

Urban cities showed to have the most amount of drivers, rides, and total fares.
Suburban cities had the second most amount of drivers, ride, and total fares.
Rural cities were the city type to have the least amount of drivers, rides, and total fares. 
Even though Urban cities had the most amount of drivers, rides, and total fares, they had the lowest average of fare per ride and fare per driver.
Whereas the opposite occurred for Rural cities because they had the hightest average of fare per ride and fare per drive despite the fact they had the lowest amount of drivers, rides, and total fares. 


Summary:

Based on the finding from the analysis, I have a few recommendations to address any disparages in the types of cities.  The first one is to make small increases or decreases in charge based off the total number of riders there are in the city during certain months. Second, I recommend that we should have the driver assigned to different city types based off of what type of cities they usually work in. Finally, we should consider increasing the charge per mile in urban city types because typically, urban city rides are much shorter leading to the driver not earning as much per trip.
